## Hi there 👋

**HARDWARE-ROOTED TRUST FOR THE AGENTIC AGE.**

EINZ is building the **Silicon Trust Protocol (STP)**, a hardware-anchored trust layer for autonomous agents. It binds agent identity to TPM/TEE-backed infrastructure, wraps delegation through Shield-MCP semantics, and attaches signed evidence to each critical action so behavior can be verified after execution.

In short, the protocol is designed to make agent systems **verifiable, accountable, and slashable**: integrity checks validate whether an agent stayed in a trusted runtime, forensic replay checks whether decisions were logically sound, and governance can escalate penalties up to global hardware revocation for malicious behavior.
